# ManInTheMoon_Processing

This is a 2D demo of our future game, The Man In the Moon! It follows the story of a small cat by the name of Chang'e and her accidental journey to the twisted alternate universe called Xanadu. Currently, the demo does not do a great job establishing her character or the lore behind the game, but this was just an opportunity for us to get familiar with the game mechanics.

to do:
  - implement school scenes
  - monster death sprites/animation
  - character death sprites/animation
  - character jumping sprites/animation
  - end screen (splash art of Xanadu?)
  - add secrets! (end of hallway, clicking on eye at bus stop, etc.)
  - set keybinds

instructions:
  - press 'a' to move left
  - press 'd' to move right
  - press space to jump
  - press control to crouch
  - click to interact
  - press 'q' to hit

settings:
  - keybinds
  - music on/off

dev mode:
  - scenes
  - start screen
  - end screen

Scene 1: Bus stop
  - Animated bus 
  - Interact

Scene 1.5: outside school + school (WIP)
  - Interact
  - Animated door
  - Clock cameo
  - Hitting mechanism
  
Scene 2: Hallway
  - In-between dimension between real world and Xanadu
  - Dark hallway
  - One door (interact)

Scene 3: Xanadu
  - Interact
  - Hitting mechanism
  - Monsters


Criteria:

50+%
  - Movement mechanisms, such as running, jumping, crouching (no need for animation).
  - One functional playing level.
  - Functional starting screen with instructions, settings, etc.
  - Cohesive storyline, can play from beginning to end with little bugs.

  - Button animation when mouse is hovering above.
  - Developer mode where devs can skip to specific scenes from the main menu.
  - Player can exit to main menu in the middle of a scene (progress is not saved).

90+% 
  - Added sound effects (door closing/opening, object picked up, certain soundtracks that play at certain times).
  - Moonlight and nightlight (secondary death mechanism).
  - Monsters chase the character (sprite tracking).
  - Natural background movement (front faster, back slower).
  - Programmer-friendly code.
  - Little to no bugs.
  - Players can pause and resume in the middle of the scene.

Nice to Haves:
  - Saving mechanisms.
  - 3rd level.
  - Volume control.
  - Players can set their own keybinds.
