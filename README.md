Notes:
  - Please use the graphics inside Assets → Graphics → Final Graphics OR Assets → Graphics → Concepts/WIP → Final concepts (for the graphics that are not finalized yet).  If there is nothing in Concepts/WIP, use a random REPLACEABLE image from your computer/google.
  - We are contractually bound to strictly prohibit the use of gore to scare people and thus will need to use ambience for the horror.
  - Please use Party Let as the font if text is needed
  - There will be no dialogue (may change)
Github: 
  - Please do not force push the code if your code conflicts with main (the team will go over the code if there are conflicts -- please communicate the conflicts through the discord (invite: ) if you are working remotely)
